/**
 * This interface defines methods for sending QUIC frames or packets to a given peer. When sending frames, the implementation
 * takes care of packaging frames into appropriate packets, taking into account limitations imposed by congestion control and
 * send priorities.
 *
 * The send methods will (almost) never lead to a synchronous send; instead, the sender implementation will queue the
 * send requests and actually send them when appropriate (what is "appropriate" is defined by the sender implementation).
 *
 * The notification methods <code>packetProcessed</code> and <code>datagramProcessed</code> should be used to notify
 * the sender implementation of these events, which enables the sender to coalesce packets efficiently.
 * For cases where sending is not triggered by processing a packet and these methods are not called, the caller must
 * call <code>flush</code> instead, to trigger the sender implementation to start packaging.

     * Sends a frame that is produced by the given frame supplier at the time the frame is actually being sent.
     * Producing the frame "just in time" has two advantages: the frame can be created with up-to-date data (e.g.
     * flow control level), avoid sending out-of-date values when the send-request has been queued for a while, and the
     * frame can take the maximum size that is available in the QUIC packet being constructed (which is especially
     * useful for stream frames).
     *
     * The minimum size is the minimal maximum frame size the frame supplier callback is able to produce; it must
     * guarantee that it can produce a frame that is not larger than this value. For fixed frames, this is simply the
     * max frame size, but for frames with varying size (e.g. stream frames), it is the max size when creating the
     * smallest frame possible (or useful) in the given circumstances. E.g. if frame size is uncertain due
     * to variable length integer encoding, this minimum should take worst case into account.
     * Note that when the frame supplier is called, it may be allowed to produce a larger frame, if packet size permits.
